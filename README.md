## 🚀 Overview

**Konten Kilat AI** is an enterprise-grade web application designed to revolutionize how businesses handle digital marketing. By leveraging state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence, we automate the creative process from visual perception to persuasive copywriting.

The system utilizes a dual-engine AI approach:
* **Vision Engine:** Google Gemini Flash 2.5 (for high-fidelity image understanding).
* **Language Engine:** Kolosal AI GLM 4.6 (for culturally nuanced Indonesian copywriting).

---

## ✨ Key Capabilities

### 👁️ Cognitive Visual Analysis
Unlike standard OCR, our Vision Engine understands context. It identifies:
* Product Materials & Quality.
* Lighting Conditions & Aesthetics.
* Brand Vibe (Luxury, Casual, Rustic, etc.).

### ✍️ Adaptive Copywriting Generation
Generates three distinct marketing angles instantly:
1.  **Viral/Trend Mode:** Optimized for TikTok/Reels algorithms (Gen Z target).
2.  **Professional Mode:** Trust-building tone for official catalogs/LinkedIn.
3.  **Storytelling Mode:** Soft-selling approach for community engagement.

### ⚡ Frictionless Workflow
* **Zero-Edit Required:** Output is pre-formatted with line breaks and emojis.
* **Smart-Share:** Direct integration links to major social platforms.
